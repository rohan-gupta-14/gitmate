## Description

**GitMate** transforms the overwhelming experience of diving into a new repository into a guided, conversational journey. By combining code parsing and AI-powered understanding. It helps in quickly grasping what any codebase does and where to make changes.

### The Problem It Solves

Ever cloned a repository and felt lost trying to understand the codebase ? It feels like being dropped into a maze blindfolded :

1. **Documentation is a myth**- READMEs are outdated, comments are scarce and you're left reverse engineering
2. **Dependency chains are invisible**- You change one function and break three others because you couldn't see what calls what
3. **Onboarding is measured in weeks**- New Team members spend their first month just trying to understand where things are and how they work
4. **Open Source feels inaccessible**- You want to contribute but don't know where to start, what's safe to touch, or how components interact

**Who struggles most ?**
- New Developers joining teams or companies.
- Open source contributors tackling their first PR.
- Anyone inheriting legacy code without the original authors.


### ✨ The GitMate Solution

GitMate transforms the codebase exploration into a guided journey. Here's How:

1. **Deep Code Understanding**
-> Tree-sitter parses your entire codebase into structured AST, extracting every function, class, variable and their relationship.

2. **AI-Powered Documentation**
-> Each code entity gets and AI-generated description explaining what it does, how it works, and why it matters.

3. **Semantic Memory**
-> Everything is embedded into a FAISS vector database, enabling natural language search.

4. **Conversational Code Navigation**
-> Chat with your codebase and have the ability to dive deeper with `/refs` and `/calls` command.

## INSTALLATION

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **Ollama** - For local embeddings ([Install Ollama](https://ollama.ai/))
- **UV** - Fast Python package manager ([Install UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))

### STEP 1 : CLONE THE REPOSITORY

```zsh
# Clone via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/bigsparsh/gitmate.git

# Or clone via SSH (if you have ssh keys configured)
git clone git@github.com:bigsparsh/gitmate.git

# Go to the project directory
cd gitmate
```

### STEP 2 : INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

```zsh
# Using pip
pip install -e

# Or Using UV (recommended)
uv sync

```

### STEP 3: CONFIGURE API KEYS

```zsh
# Set your Groq API Key
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

```

### STEP 4: PULL THE EMBEDDED MODEL

```zsh
# Pull the embedding model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### STEP 5: LSP SETUP (OPTIONAL)

This step is optional it is used for enhanced tracking and call hierarchy features :
```zsh
# For C/C++ support
sudo apt install clangd    #UBUNTU/DEBIAN
sudo pacman -S clang       #Arch Linux
brew install llvm          #macOS
```

## USAGE

### Starting GitMate

```zsh
python main.py
```
![GitMate Running](backend/assets/1%20final.png)

You'll be prompted to enter Github Repo URL. After that GitMate will:

**1. Clone the repository to `/tmp/gitmate/`**

Enter any GitHub repository URL to begin analysis. For example : ( https://github.com/bigsparsh/bgdb.git )

**2. Using Tree-sitter GitMate will parse through all the source files and it will also initialize the LSP Server (if available)**

![Extracting and initializing](backend/assets/2%20final.png)

**3. AI will start analyzing and generating each entity signatures of function, variables and macros**
